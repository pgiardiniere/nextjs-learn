Thoughts on 1-week with react

NEXTJS LEARN modules:
  From JavaScript to React:
    GOD there are so many RULES.
    This developer experience is fucking atrocious.
    I would much rather just work in Flutter web, Svelte, god just anything else

    It destroys the workflow having to remember when to capitalize functions, components,
    all this stuff is just rote memorization. It's truly bad.
